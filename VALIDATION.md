# Validation

## 2026-10-29 portability release / 新手机部署修复

The APKs package the migration fixes. The original signing identities were compared against APKs pulled from the connected phone before each upgrade; all four updated in place. SIP, DDNS and gateway account configuration hashes were unchanged. The temporary KSU BusyBox alias was removed; Magisk-backed IPv6 selection, both independent monitors and Asterisk authenticated echo self-test (61 returned packets) still passed. The temporary Wi-Fi boot hook was removed by the APK-owned runtime.

电话权限向导在实机完成授权后，网关自行恢复 Shizuku CONNECTED、audioReady、SIP ready。绑定超时重试日志已在实机观察到；未自动批准系统权限。号码库及空姓名修复已由 APK 部署，AGI 四项回归测试和部署八项检查通过。完整网关 JVM 测试通过，包括权限缺失、返回空数据、绑定超时、晚到回调及停止时取消重试。

An APK install is not a silent private-account restore or a cross-ROM audio guarantee. Fresh installation still requires user-approved Root/Shizuku/system permissions and local account setup. No private credentials, signing keys or permission databases are included in this release. The original cellular audio implementation is unchanged.

## Final manual call validation / 最终实际通话验证

2026-10-29: after disabling the iPhone VPN, the user confirmed SIP echo, two-way cellular audio, Groundwire lock-screen incoming push and caller-number grouping. The failed media attempt advertised the VPN address `198.18.0.1` and delivered no client RTP. Packet diagnostics recorded only addresses and counters, not audio. No real cellular calls were initiated automatically.

用户确认关闭 iPhone VPN 后，回声、普通号码双向声音、锁屏推送和号码分段均正常。网关原生音频实现未改动；新手机流程通过隔离配置与现有手机原签名升级验证，没有清空用户手机做出厂重置测试。
